# Strings

Blade has a very rich support for strings and they can be expressed in several ways. In Blade, 
strings are denoted by enclosing characters in pairs of single quotes (`'...'`) or pairs of 
double quotes (`"..."`) and they are essentially the same.

When strings are wrapped in `'` or `"`, you can escape that quotation within the string using 
the backslash (`\`).

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'string in single quote'
'string in single quote'
%> "another version with double quotes"
'another version with double quotes'
%> 'What\'s the escape character?'
"What's the escape character?"
%> "It's the \"\\\" character"
"It's the "\" character"
```

> All Blade strings can span multiple lines whether created using single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
>
> For example:
> ```blade
> # with single quotes
> 'Hello...
> World'
> 
> # same with double quotes
> "I am
> a living
> Legend!"
> ```

In the REPL mode, strings are enclosed in quotes based on the kind of data they contains. If a
string contains no quote, it is wrapped in single quotes (`'...'`). If it contains a single quote,
it is wrapped in double quotes (`"..."`). If it contains both, the latter is used. This is simply
for presentation purpose. This is to discourage readers from confusing them with language schematics.

The `print()` function produces a result that is more like what you'd expect. It does no extra 
processing of the output.

For example:

```blade-repl
%> print("It's the \"\\\" character")
It's the "\" character
```

Blade strings support a lot of special characters called `escape sequence` for formatting and 
they also need to be escaped with `\` as follows:

| Sequence | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `\a` | Alert (Beep, Bell) |
| `\b` | Backspace |
| `\f` | Formfeed Page Break |
| `\n` | Newline |
| `\r` | Carriage Return |
| `\t` | Horizontal Tab |
| `\v` | Vertical Tab |
| `\\` | Backslash |
| `\'` | Single Quotation Mark |
| `\"` | Dobule Quotation Mark |
| `\0` | String terminator |
| `\$` | Escape for interpolated strings |
| `\xhh` | Hexadecimal number |
| `\uhhhh` | Unicode code point below 10000 hexadecimal |
| `\Uhhhhhhhhh` | Unicode code point where h is a hexadecimal digit |

> 1. _`h`_ stands for hexadecimal digit.
> 2. `\0` used anywhere in a string will cause the rest of the string to be ignored and useless.
> 3. `\$` _See the [`Interpolated Strings`](#string-interpolation) section below._
> 4. `\u` takes 4 hexadecimal digits _h_ after it.
> 5. `\U` takes 8 hexadecimal digits _h_ after it.


## Unicode and UTF-8
---

As mentioned in the previous section, Blade strings fully supports unicode and are UTF-8 encoded by default.
Unicode code points can be represented using Unicode `\u` and `\U` escape sequences.

For example,

```blade-repl
%> '\u00a9'
'©'
%> '10\u00B5s'
'10µs'
%> '\U0002B695 is a chinese character'
'𫚕 is a chinese character'
```

Unicode characters can also be written directly in strings. This means, that in a Blade string, you can
actually use advanced texts like smilies, trademarks and many more directly in your source code.

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'I am 😀'
'I am 😀'
%> 'Black ♞ rule'
'Black ♞ rule'
%> '道可道非常道，名可名非常名'
'道可道非常道，名可名非常名'
```

To verify our UTF-8 support, how about we try to get the length of the chinese string `名可名非常名`. 
With UTF-8 support, the length of this string should be six (6) and much longer without UTF-8 support. 
To get the length of the string, we can call it's `length()` method.

For example,

```blade-repl
%> '名可名非常名'.length()
6
%> 'Hello, World'.length() # compared with English text
12
```

As you can see, Blade returns the correct length irrespective of the language of the source text.


## String Interpolation
---

As we write more code, we seldom find ourselves needing to join two strings together or at other times,
join a string to a declared variable. Some other times, we want to have the result of an operation or 
expression within our string. All of these operations can soon become pretty verbose and tedious. Blade
allows _interpolation_ into string literals using the `$` character just as can be seen in Perl and Dart.

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'Sum after addition = ${10 + 15}'
'Sum after addition = 25'
```

The above example shows the general construct for string interpolation. Start interpolation with the 
dollar (`$`) character, and wrap the interpolated expression within curly braces `{}` as shown above.

For another example, let's say we have two variables `x` and `y` declared as `Number` and `String` 
respectively and we want to have them _concatenated_ to our string at some location, we can have 
something like the following:

```blade-repl
%> 'We have ${x} crates of ${y}'
'We have 20 crates of eggs'
```

To write the interpolation expression within a string without interpreting it, we need to escape the `$`
with a backslash (`\`) as follows:

```blade-repl
%> 'Sample interpolation: \${x * y}'
'Sample interpolation: ${x * y}'
```

## Characters
---

In Blade, _Characters_ are essentially strings with a length of one (1). No more, no less! However, there are 
times when we require Characters over Strings. For example, the builtin `ord()` function expects a character
and not a String. While this distinction looks thin, it is a very important distinction that must be put
to heart.

Characters are also UTF-8 compliant.

The sample code below shows an example of the clear distinctive use of characters and strings.

```blade-repl
%> echo ord('A')
65
%> echo ord('AB')
Unhandled Exception: ord() expects character as argument, string given
  StackTrace:
    <repl>:1 -> @.script()
```

A more complex example that skips a lot into the future of this tutorial is given as below for reference.

```blade-repl
%> import types
%> types.char('a')
true
%> types.char('ab')
false
%> types.char('地')
true
%> types.char('地点')
false
```

> Characters are always interchangeable for strings, but not the reverse.

## String Operations
---

Blade strings support multiple operations categorized into one of the following four groups.

Two or more strings can be concatenated (glued together) via the `+` operator whether it's a literal or 
a variable, and a specific string can be repeated by multiplying it with a number via the `*` operator. 

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'str' + 'ing'
'string'
%> 'abc' * 4 # repeating 'abc' four times
'abcabcabcabc'
%> 'hat!' * 4 + 'rick' # and even in a more complex form
'hat!hat!hat!hat!rick'
```

The `+` operator is quite powerful with a string, allowing you to add a string to a number or a number 
to a string.

For example,

```blade-repl
%> 5 + 'alive'
'5alive'
%> 'Base' + 64
'Base64'
```

Strings can also be checked for equality or inequality as needed. For example:

```blade-repl
%> "abracadabra" == "xylophone"
false
%> "Hello, world." != "Goodbye, world."
true
%> "1 + 2 = 3" == "1 + 2 = ${1 + 2}"
true
```

Strings indexes can be accessed. The first character of a Blade string have an index of `0`. The result of 
string indexes are characters.

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'Hello'[0]
'H'
%> 'Hello'[3]
'l'
```

Strings indexes can also be accessed with negative numbers. When using negative numbers to access string
indexes, note that the indexes will be returned in reverse. i.e. we start counting from the far right
where the first index will be `-1` (since -0 is the same as 0).

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'Hello'[-1]
'o'
%> 'Hello'[-4]
'e'
```

Note that trying to access a non-existing index or an index out of the range of the length of the string
will result in an error.

For example, the following code throws an exception.

```blade-repl
%> 'Hello'[6]
Unhandled Exception: string index 6 out of range
  StackTrace:
    <repl>:1 -> @.script()
```

In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain subparts of a string.

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'Blade'[0,3] # characters starting from index 0 to index 3 - 1 (2)
'Bla'
%> 'Blade'[2,5] # characters from index 2 to index 5 - 1 (4)
'ade'
```

The general syntax for slicing in Blade is `[lower limit, upper limit]`. Both lower limit and upper limit
can be omitted. When the lower limit is omitted, it defaults to `0` and when the upper limit is omitted,
it defaults to the length of the object e.g. the string length.

As with general indexing, the upper limit can also use negative numbers and follows the same rules as 
indexing with a negative number. A negative number in the lower limit will cause an empty object to be 
returned.

> 1. Slices are lower limit inclusive and upper limit exclusive. For example, slice `[0,3]` will return
> a substring starting from index `0` (inclusive) to index `2` and index itself will be excluded.
> 2. Index `in[,i] + in[i,]` is equal to the value of `in`. 

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'Blade'[0,3]  # starting from index 0 to 2
'Bla'
%> 'Blade'[2,5]  # starting from index 2 to 4
'ade'
%> 'Blade'[,]   # starting from index 0 to the end
'Blade'
%> 'Blade'[,-3]   # starting from index 0 to string length - 3
'Bl'
%> 'Blade'[3,]  # starting from index 3 to the end
'de'
%> 'Blade'[-1,]  # negative index in lower limit returns an empty string
''
%> 'Blade'[,4]   # starting from index 0 to 3
'Blad'
%> 'Blade'[,3] + 'Blade'[3,]     # in[,i] + in[i,]
'Blade'
```

Blade strings are immutable. Hence, a string cannot be changed. Assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error:

For example,

```blade-repl
> 'Blade'[0] = 'J'
Unhandled Exception: strings do not support object assignment
  StackTrace:
    <repl>:1 -> @.script()
```

> You may notice how we are trying to assign to a string object directly instead of a variable and think
> that's why it isn't working. That's not why! In blade, if string wasn't immutable (e.g. Lists aren't 
> immutable), Blade will go ahead and do that assignment. The fact that you aren't storing that value 
> anywhere is up to you. But it's neither a syntax nor runtime error to do so.

If you need to to modify a string, you need to create a new one. Don't worry, Blade is smart enough to 
know when you don't need a string anymore and will gracefully delete the string for memory when necessary.

## String Methods
---

Blade string comes with a lot of powerful text processing capabilities wrapped in methods described below.

{:#length} _string_.**length**()
: Returns the length of a string. Note that this method is UTF-8 compartible and will return the UTF-8 
  length for the string if the string contains UTF-8 characters whether written directly or via the
  `\u` or `\U` escapes.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'This is a pretty long string'.length()
  28
  > 'उनका एक समय'.length()
  11
  > 'This text mixes English and 粵語'.length()
  30
  ```

^
{:#upper} _string_.**upper**()
: Returns a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to uppercase. Note that the result
  of this method may return `false` when tested with `is_upper()` of the _string_ contains Unicode
  characters that are not case folded.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'blade'.upper()
  'BLADE'
  ```

^
{:#lower} _string_.**lower**()
: Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to lowercase.<br>
  
  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'Blade Is Bae'.lower()
  'blade is bae'
  ```

^
{:#is_alpha} _string_.**is_alpha**()
: Returns `true` if all the characters in the string are all alphabeths and the string is not empty.,
  otherwise returns `false`.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'abracadabra'.is_alpha()
  true
  > 'my tooth aches'.is_alpha()
  false
  > ''.is_alpha()
  false
  ```

^
{:#is_alnum} _string_.**is_alnum**()
: Returns `true` if all the characters in the string are either alphabeths or numbers and the string is 
  not empty, otherwise returns `false`. This method is the same as `string.is_alpha() or string.is_number()`.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > '3Idiots'.is_alnum()
  true
  > 'Three Idiots'.is_alnum()
  false
  > '3 Idiots'.is_alnum()
  false
  > '3'.is_alnum()
  true
  > 'idiots'.is_alnum()
  true
  > ''.is_alnum()
  false
  ```

^
{:#is_number} _string_.**is_number**()
: Returns `true` if all the characters in the string are all digits and the string is not empty,
  otherwise returns `false`.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > '123.5'.is_number()
  false
  > '1970'.is_number()
  true
  > '1980s'.is_number()
  false
  ```

^
{:#is_lower} _string_.**is_lower**()
: Returns `true` if at least one character in the string is cased, all cased characters are lower cased
  and the string is not empty. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'all'.is_lower()
  true
  > 'all...123'.is_lower()
  true
  > 'All...123'.is_lower()
  false
  > ''.is_lower()
  false
  ```

^
{:#is_upper} _string_.**is_upper**()
: Returns `true` if at least one character in the string is cased, all cased characters are upper cased
  and the string is not empty. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'ALL'.is_upper()
  true
  > 'ALL...123'.is_upper()
  true
  > 'All...123'.is_upper()
  false
  > ''.is_upper()
  false
  ```

^
{:#is_space} _string_.**is_space**()
: Returns `true` if there are only whitespace characters in the string and the string is not empty.
  Otherwise, it returns empty.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > '.     '.is_space()
  false
  > '\r\n'.is_space()
  true
  > '\t  '.is_space()
  true
  ```

^
{:#trim} _string_.**trim**([_chr_: char])
: Returns a copy of the string with the given character (_`chr`_) removed if it appears at the start or 
  end of the string. If _`chr`_ is not given, it defaults to a space (`' '`). All matching leading and 
  trailing characters are removed until a character that doesn't match is encountered. If no match is 
  found, a copy of the original string is returned.

  > The square brackets (`[]`) around the _`chr: char`_ in the method definition indicates that the 
  > parameter is optional and does not mean you have to type the square brackets.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > '  example  '.trim()
  'example'
  > '  example  '.trim('e')
  '  example  '
  > 'example'.trim('e')
  'xampl'
  ```

^
{:#ltrim} _string_.**ltrim**([_chr_: char])
: Similar to the `trim()` method, except that this method only removes characters at the begining of 
  the string.
  
  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > '  example  '.ltrim()
  'example  '
  > 'example'.ltrim('e')
  'xample'
  ```

^
{:#rtrim} _string_.**rtrim**([_chr_: char])
: Similar to the `trim()` method, except that this method only removes characters at the end of 
  the string.
  
  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > '  example  '.rtrim()
  '  example'
  > 'example'.rtrim('e')
  'exampl'
  ```

^
{:#join} _string_.**join**(_iterable_: string | list | dict)
: Returns a stringwhich is a concatenation of the items in the iterable using the _string_ as the 
  separator. If the iterable contains just one item or the _string_ is empty, the original element 
  is returned. If the _iterable_ contains non-string items, the items are converted to their string 
  representation before joining.
  
  `Bytes` are the only non supported iterables.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > ','.join(['ok', 1, true])
  'ok,1,true'
  > '--'.join('name')
  'n--a--m--e'
  > ','.join('a')
  'a'
  ```

^
{:#split} _string_.**split**(_delimiter_: string)
: Returns a list of words or characters in a string after separating the content of the string at every
  point where the _delimiter_ is found. 
  
  If the _delimiter_ is an empty string, the resultant list will contain the individual characters of 
  the string in the order in which they appear in the original string. Consecutive delimiters are not 
  grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty strings. Splitting an empty string with a specified 
  separator returns an empty list.

  This method has full UTF-8 support.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'name'.split('')
  [n, a, m, e]
  > '1<>2<>3'.split('<>')
  [1, , 2, , 3]
  > '1,2,3'.split(',')
  [1, 2, 3]
  > ''.split(',')
  []
  > '地点'.split('')
  [地, 点]
  ```

^
{:#index_of} _string_.**index_of**(_str_: string)
: Returns the index position of the first occurrence of the string _`str`_ in the string _`string`_. If
  the _str_ cannot be found anywhere in _string_, it returns -1.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  > 'hello, world'.index_of(' ')
  6
  > 'hello, world'.index_of('e')
  1
  > 'hello, world'.index_of('q')
  -1
  ```

^
{:#starts_with} _string_.**starts_with**(_str_: string)
: Returns `true` if the string begins with the string or character specified in _str_, otherwise 
  it returns `false`.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'hello, world'.starts_with('hello')
  true
  %> 'hello, world'.starts_with('hellios')
  false
  ```

^
{:#ends_with} _string_.**ends_with**(_str_: string)
: Returns `true` if the string ends with the string or character specified in _str_, otherwise 
  it returns `false`.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'gumtree'.ends_with('tree')
  true
  %> 'gumtree'.ends_with('mree')
  false
  ```

^
{:#count} _string_.**count**(_str_: string)
: Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring _str_ in the string. 
  
  _For those coming from Python who may consider this method similar to Python's own, this 
  method differs in that it does not allow specifying a start and end region for the operation. 
  Blade considers this unnessary as the same can be accomplished by slicing the string._

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'Hallelujah'.count('l')
  3
  %> 'ding dong'.count('ng')
  2
  %> 'ding dong'[2,7].count('ng') # setting region to search for counts - 'ng do'
  1
  ```

^
{:#to_number} _string_.**to_number**()
: Returns the first numeric value contained in the string if any exists or `0` if the string
  contains no numeric value. Floating numbers that have the same value as their integer counterparts
  will return the integer value.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> '123.0 hell'.to_number()
  123
  %> '427 and 12'.to_number()
  427
  %> '96.3 of 31'.to_number()
  96.3
  %> 'error'.to_number()
  0
  ```

^
{:#to_list} _string_.**to_list**()
: Returns a list whose elements consists of every character contained in the string in order of
  appearance. Characters that repeat in the string will have different entries in the same index
  as they appear in the string.<br>

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'Blade'.to_list()
  [B, l, a, d, e]
  %> 'Plantation'.to_list()
  [P, l, a, n, t, a, t, i, o, n]
  ```

^
{:#to_bytes} _string_.**to_bytes**()
: Returns the content of the string as a stream of `bytes`. 
  
  > The Blade REPL _may_ trunctuate long bytes data when printing to console/terminal.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'Blade'.to_bytes()
  (42 6c 61 64 65)
  %> 'Plantation'.to_bytes()
  (50 6c 61 6e 74 61 74 69 6f 6e)
  ```

^
{:#lpad} _string_.**lpad**(_width_: number [, _fill_: char])
: Returns the string left justified in a string of length _width_. Padding is done using the specified 
  character _fill_ if given of a space (`' '`) if a _fill_ is not specified. The original string is 
  returned if width is less than _`string.length()`_.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'cat'.lpad(5)
  '  cat'
  %> 'cat'.lpad(5, '-')
  '--cat'
  %> 'cat'.lpad(2, '-')
  'cat'
  ```

^
{:#rpad} _string_.**rpad**(_width_: number [, _fill_: char]))
: Returns the string right justified in a string of length _width_. Padding is done using the specified 
  character _fill_ if given of a space (`' '`) if a _fill_ is not specified. The original string is 
  returned if width is less than _`string.length()`_.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'Hmm'.rpad(6)
  'Hmm   '
  %> 'Hmm'.rpad(6, '.')
  'Hmm...'
  %> 'Hmm'.rpad(3, '.')
  'Hmm'
  ```

^
{:#match} _string_.**match**(_str_: string | regex)
: If the string _str_ is a regular string, this method returns `true` if the _string_ contains a
  substring _str_. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

  If the string _str_ contains a valid [regular expression](#regular-expressions) (we'll get to that shortly below), it returns `false` if a match for the regex _str_ cannot be found in the string. Otherwise, it 
  returns a [dictionary](./dictionaries) containing all first matching substring.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'gorilla'.match('go')      # regular string match
  true
  %> 'gorilla'.match('gox')     # regular string non-match
  false
  %> 'gorilla'.match('/gox?/')  # regular expression match
  {0: go}
  %> 'gorilla'.match('/gox\d/') # regular expression non-match
  false
  ```

^
{:#matches} _string_.**matches**(_reg_: regex)
: Returns a dictionary containing every match of the given regular expression _reg_ in the source string.
  If no match is found, an empty [dictionary](./dictionaries) is returned.

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> '123 dollars'.matches('/[a-z]+|\d+/')
  {0: [123, dollars]}
  %> 'who is in the garden'.matches('/\w+/')
  {0: [who, is, in, the, garden]}
  ```

^
{:#replace} _string_.**replace**(_str_: regex | string, _replacement_: string)
: Returns a copy of the string with all occurrences or matches of _str_ replaced by the _replacement_
  string.

  In the _replacement_ string, if _str_ is a regular expression, then capture groups can be referenced
  using the syntax `$index`. Taking as an example, capture group `0` contains the entire match and 
  can be used in the _replacement_ string as `$0`.

  > To escape the `$` sign in the _replacement_ string, use the double backslashed (`\\`).

  For example:

  ```blade-repl
  %> 'lady friend'.replace('d', 'z')  # non-regex
  'lazy frienz'
  %> 'John is 26 years old'.replace('/(\d+)/', '1$1') # regex example
  'John is 126 years old'
  %> 'John is 26 years old'.replace('/(\d+)/', '1\\$2')
  'John is 1$2 years old'
  ```

Apart from the above listed methods, String also implements the _[Iterable Decorators](./class)_ which
we'll talk about in details under the _[Class](./class)_ lesson.

## Regular Expressions
---

Regular expressions in Blade are simply special patterns expressed in a string following a few guidlines
that allow them to be distinguished by methods requiring them. We'll be using the term `regex` or `regexes` 
henceforth for the rest of this tutorial and most likely for the rest of the documentation.

Blade's _regex_ is built on-top the _PCRE2_ library, an excellent library that already powers regular 
expression in many programming languages and have been around for decades. It feels like a better choice
for now for Blade to depend on this library rather than invest years building one robust enough to match
the library's capabilites.

In simple words, Blade's _regex_ is PCRE compatible.

To create a valid _regex_ in Blade, **your regex pattern must be surrounded by identical non-word characters**.

For example, `/\d+/`. Note here how we surround our pattern `\d+` with forward slashes (`/`).

This tutorial will not attempt to teach regular expressions as there are many wonderful texts already
written on that topic as well as many online tools for learning them in greater depths than we can cover 
in this tutorial. Majority of them based on the same engine we are using. So here's 
[one of them](https://regexr.com/){:target="_blank"} for your reference.

Most languages support different modifiers for regular expressions, and Blade has some too. Modifiers
are placed after a valid regex to control how the pattern is executed by the language. For example, in
Blade, the pattern `/[a-z]/i` is a pattern modified with the `i` modifier telling the interpreter to
make sure the matching is done case insensitive.

The following table lists Blade modifiers.

| Modifier | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| `i` | Case insensitive matching |
| `m` | Multi-line. This mode cases `^` and `$` to match newlines. |
| `s` | Dot (`.`) matches all |
| `x` | Extended matching (Ignore whitespace and `#` comments) |
| `A` | Force pattern anchoring |
| `D` | Do not match newline at the end. In this mode, `$` will be the only valid line terminator. |
| `U` | Ungreedy match. |
| `u` | Treat pattern and subjects as UTF strings and use Unicode properties for \d, \w, etc. |

Modifiers can be joined together to form a more powerful modification instruction. For example, you
can perform a multi-line and case-insensitive modification for our former sample as `/[a-z]/mi`.

For example:

```blade-repl
%> 'The side bar includes a Cheatsheet'.matches('/([A-Z])\w+/')
{0: [The, Cheatsheet], 1: [T, C]}
```

Or the same query with modifiers,

```blade-repl
%> 'The side bar includes a Cheatsheet'.matches('/([A-Z])\w+/sim')
{0: [The, side, bar, includes, Cheatsheet], 1: [T, s, b, i, C]}
```
