# Getting Started

If you have installed Blade or still thinking about whether to install it or not (I seriously hope you do),
you must have an idea of what Blade is and why Blade.

## TL;DR
---

If you fall into one of more of this categories or have one of the following needs, then Blade is the right language for you.

- You want a language with a very minimal learning curve (easier to learn than Python).
- You want Python's simplicity but love coding with braces and other things C-like.
- You want a language with first-class support for package management.
- You need a quick script for automating mundane tasks on your device.
- You need a language that allows fast prototyping.
- You want to do backend development without needing to depend on a framework.
- You want a familiar language that can be embedded into your application that's more extensive than Lua.

There are many more use-cases where Blade is a great fit. This is just the bare minimal.

## The Prose
---

If you've ever had experience with a compiled language (e.g. C/C++, Java, etc), then one thing you'll quickly
notice (at least I did) was how much the whole process of write-compile-run-debug can be tedious and get
in the way of creative programming and sometimes you even forget that mind-blowing algorithm you were going
to write and take over the world in the whole process of compiling.

Sometimes, you just want to automate a few tasks, for example, I have a simple program to always remind me to
get away from my laptop and eat something (you know how it is) and yet another one to suggest food for me.
Do you find yourself needing this often? Do you know why you haven't written it? Get out of your head, you are
writing a compiled language! Compiling takes longer than the time it will take you to convince yourself that
you need to eat.

At other times, you have written this amazing program and you want users to be able to control it using a simple
scripting language. I know... I know... there are many interpreted languages out there that will do the job just
fine. Well... you still have one problem. Your users aren't going to remember all the crazy going on in many of 
them (Yes Lua! I'm staring at you. What you gonna do about it?)

Other times, we kind of find a very good solution to our problem in languages like Python (I must confess, even
Blade did learn a lot of things from it), but the structure of such languages usually creates a new overhead in
writing complex programs. It's really difficult keeping a tab of indentations in such languages especially when you are not in a GUI IDE environment. I tried to work Python in `nano`, but man... it wasn't easy.

If you are feeling me, then Blade is just right for you.

Blade is a simple language that has tried very much to learn from the mistake and successes of its predecessors.

Blade is interpreted and simple like Python but with a more generic C-like syntax and a ridiculously simple
Object-orientation similar to Dart and the granularity of JavaScript while still maintaining a very minimal syntax and keywords when compared to all of them.

Blade is designed to be a memorizable language and the entire "language" can be learned in one sitting. However,
Blade is as complete and powerful as any language can be and can be applied in the field of web, mobile, desktop,
scientific, academic and research engineering to mention a few.

_Now, let us get started!_
